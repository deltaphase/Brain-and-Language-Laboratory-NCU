- How do we analyze neural signals? What is the difference between Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG)?  &nbsp;
- How do we search for a topic among a wide variety of research studies and design a neurolinguistic experiment?  &nbsp;
- Is reading performance associated with brain activities? How does learning new words or languages affect brain activity patterns?  &nbsp;
- Could functional brain imaging signals assist the diagnosis and treatment for developmental language impairment?  &nbsp;
- The characteristics of Chinese morphology, syntax, and prosody are very different than those of alphabetic languages. Would Chinese speakers thus employ distinct neural circuits when processing language?  &nbsp;
- What are the differences between computational natural language processing and the actual processing of language in the brain?  &nbsp;

If you are interested in any of the questions above, you are encouraged to join our lab! The Brain and Language Laboratory conducts interdisciplinary studies on topics such as signal analysis, linguistics, and computational neuroscience.   &nbsp;
